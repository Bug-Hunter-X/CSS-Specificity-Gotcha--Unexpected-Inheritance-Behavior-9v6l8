To correct this, you need to increase the specificity of the `div p` selector.  Several ways to do this include:

1. **Adding an extra class:**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}

div .special-paragraph {
  color: green; /* added class selector for specificity */
}
```

2. **Using more specific selectors (if applicable):**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div > p {
  color: green; /* Using the child combinator increases specificity */
}
```

By increasing specificity, you ensure the style applied to `div p` is prioritized over the style applied to `div`, resulting in the expected green text color.
