The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common yet subtle error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, the `<p>` element within a `<div>` element will unexpectedly have a blue color, not green.  This is because the specificity of `div p` is lower than that of `div`. While `div p` directly styles the nested `<p>`, the `div` selector's specificity is higher since it applies to *all* elements within the div, including the `p` tag. In such cases, the style from the parent element (`div`) overrides the more specific selector (`div p`).
